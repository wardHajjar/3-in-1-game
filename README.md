Hello!
This game should be run on a Pixel 3 API 28. Our game consists of 3 levels that are completed in
succession in order to escape the dungeon. Note that if you exit a level in the middle,
(without completing it) your progress from that level will not be saved and it will return to the
level you were last on the next time the game is loaded.

Thanks and we hope you enjoy our game!
